Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s Style Guide for documenting which you may follow:

# with overline, for parts
* with overline, for chapters
=, for sections
-, for subsections
^, for subsubsections
", for paragraphs
Of course, you are free to use your own marker characters (see the reST documentation), and use a deeper nesting level, but keep in mind that most target formats (HTML, LaTeX) have a limited supported nesting depth.
