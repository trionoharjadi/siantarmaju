guide


Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Python’s Style Guide for documenting which you may follow:

* # with overline, for parts
* * with overline, for chapters
* =, for sections
* -, for subsections
* ^, for subsubsections
* ", for paragraphs
Of course, you are free to use your own marker characters (see the reST documentation), and use a deeper nesting level, but keep in mind that most target formats (HTML, LaTeX) have a limited supported nesting depth.
